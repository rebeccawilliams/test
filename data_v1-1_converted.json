The PACA protects businesses dealing in fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables by establishing and enforcing a code of fair business practices and by helping companies resolve business disputes.\r\n \r\nThe PACA Branch is responsible for administering the PACA and offers many services to the industry. PACA Branch experts receive hundreds of telephone calls each week from companies requesting assistance on problems unique to the industry such as interpretation of inspection certificates, advice on contract disputes, and bankruptcy payments.\r\n\r\nThe PACA Search Engine is an online tool that allows the public to determine if a business is licensed under the PACA, users can also see companies

These data provide comprehensive and accurate information on milk supplies, utilization, and sales, as well as class prices established under the orders and prices paid to dairy farmers (producers). The sources of this data are monthly reports of receipts and utilization, producer payroll reports, and reports of nonpool handlers filed by milk processors (handlers) subject to the provisions of the various milk orders. The local market administrator (MA) uses these reports to determine pool obligations under the order and to verify proper payments to producers. Auditors employed by the MA review handler records to assure the accuracy of reported information. Reporting errors are corrected; if necessary, pool obligations are revised.\r\n\r\nAfter the pool obligations have been determined the local market administrator summarizes the individual handler reports and submits a series of order summary reports to the Market Information Branch (MIB) in Dairy Programs. The MIB summarizes the individual order data and disseminates this information via monthly, bimonthly, and annual releases or publications. Since milk marketing order statistics are based on reports filed by the population of possible reporting firms and not a sample, these statistics are comprehensive. Also, since these individual firm reports are subject to audit and verification, these statistics are accurate.\r\n\r\nThe Federal milk order statistics database contains historical information, beginning in January 2000, generated by the administration of the Federal milk order program.

For the DSID studies, representative supplement products are identified, sampled and analyzed by experienced laboratories. In order to obtain accurate results, a quality assurance and quality control plan are established for each study, with standard reference materials, in-house control materials and product duplicate results assessed before product data are accepted as final.  Laboratory data are then statistically evaluated by ingredient and weighted by market share information, if available. For the MVM studies released in DSID-2, data are reported by ingredient across a range of labeled levels.  Results are predicted by regression and estimate mean percent differences from label and standard errors at these labeled levels. These data can be used by researchers to more accurately quantify nutrient intake from dietary

This study sought to control for the SNAP participation \u201cselection bias\u201d by comparing information collected from households within days of entering the program (new entrants) to information obtained after about 6 months of participation.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http:\/\/www.fns.usda.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/Measuring2013.pdf","mediaType":"application\/pdf"}],"identifier":"USDA-FNS-42","keyword":["FNS","Food security","SNAP","household"],"license":"https:\/\/project-open-data.cio.gov\/unknown-license\/#v1-legacy\/License+Not+Specified","modified":"2013-08-16","programCode":["005:056"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Risk Management Agency, Department of Agriculture"},"spatial":"United States","title":"Measuring the Effect of SNAP Participation on Food Security"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","rights":"Public","bureauCode":["005:84"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Megan Heyns","hasEmail":"mailto:megan.heyns@RMA.USDA.GOV"},"dataQuality":true,"description":"This report presents estimates that, for each state, measure the need for SNAP and the program\u2019s effectiveness in each of the three years from 2009 to 2011.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http:\/\/www.fns.usda.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/techpartrate2009-2011.pdf","mediaType":"application\/pdf"}],"identifier":"USDA-FNS-41","keyword":["FNS","Program Effectiveness","SNAP"],"license":"https:\/\/project-open-data.cio.gov\/unknown-license\/#v1-legacy\/License+Not+Specified","modified":"2014-03-11","programCode":["005:056"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Risk Management Agency, Department of Agriculture"},"spatial":"United States","title":"Empirical Bayes Shrinkage Estimates of State SNAP Participation Rates"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","rights":"Public","bureauCode":["005:84"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Megan Heyns","hasEmail":"mailto:megan.heyns@RMA.USDA.GOV"},"description":"This handbook describes D - SNAP policy, provides lessons learned from previous D-SNAPs, and contains toolkits to help SNAP offices plan for, organize, and operate a D-SNAP.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http:\/\/www.fns.usda.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/D-SNAP_handbook.pdf","mediaType":"application\/pdf"}],"identifier":"USDA-FNS-21","keyword":["SNAP","agricultural policy","disaster"],"license":"https:\/\/project-open-data.cio.gov\/unknown-license\/#v1-legacy\/License+Not+Specified","modified":"2014-06-12T18:55:50.541523","programCode":["005:056"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Risk Management Agency, Department of Agriculture"},"spatial":"United States","title":"Disaster SNAP Guidance"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","rights":"Public","bureauCode":["005:84"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Megan Heyns","hasEmail":"mailto:megan.heyns@RMA.USDA.GOV"},"dataQuality":true,"description":"A summary of current WIC policy and regulatory citations that are specifically relevant to WIC Program operation during disaster situations, usually hurricanes, in which WIC participants have been evacuated from their homes and relocated to other areas within their home States, or to another State.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http:\/\/www.fns.usda.gov\/wic\/detailed-policy-guidance-disaster-situations","mediaType":"text\/html"}],"identifier":"USDA-FNS-28","keyword":["disaster","guidance","hurricanes","state policy"],"license":"https:\/\/project-open-data.cio.gov\/unknown-license\/#v1-legacy\/License+Not+Specified","modified":"2013-11-20","programCode":["005:054"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Risk Management Agency, Department of Agriculture"},"spatial":"United States","title":"Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Detailed Policy Guidance in Disaster Situations"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","rights":"Public","bureauCode":["005:84"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Megan Heyns","hasEmail":"mailto:megan.heyns@RMA.USDA.GOV"},"dataQuality":true,"description":"To encourage Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  participants to shop at farmers markets, various organizations have been providing financial incentives to participants who redeem SNAP benefits at participating farmers markets.

Aerial retardant avoidance area for hydrographic feature data are based on high resolution National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) produced by USGS and available from the USFS Enterprise Data Warehouse. Forests and\/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features.The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Using the FCODE attribute, streams\/rivers\/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent\/ephemeral types. Linear features (streams & rivers) FCODES 46003 and 46006 and polygonal features (lakes and other waterbody) FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43612, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittentt\/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. Underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded. Initially, all intermittent\/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest\/Region units. Subsequently, Forest\/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. The resulting avoidance areas may have overlapping features due to the buffering processes.The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000\/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http:\/\/catalog.data.gov\/dataset\/us-forest-service-aerial-fire-retardant-avoidance-area-hydro","mediaType":"text\/html"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http:\/\/apps.fs.fed.us\/ArcX\/rest\/services\/EDW\/EDW_AerialFireRetardantHydrographicAvoidanceAreas_01\/MapServer","mediaType":"text\/html"}],"identifier":"USDA-FS-00021","keyword":["Aerial Fire","Fire","Retardant","forest service","hydro","usfs"],"landingPage":"http:\/\/apps.fs.fed.us\/ArcX\/rest\/services\/EDW\/EDW_AerialFireRetardantHydrographicAvoidanceAreas_01\/MapServer","license":"https:\/\/project-open-data.cio.gov\/unknown-license\/#v1-legacy\/Creative+Commons+Attribution","modified":"2014-12-03T23:36:07.867504","programCode":["005:000"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Risk Management Agency, Department of Agriculture"},"temporal":"2013\/2014","title":"U.S. Forest Service Aerial Fire Retardant Avoidance Area Hydro"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["005:96"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Megan Heyns","hasEmail":"mailto:megan.heyns@RMA.USDA.GOV"},"description":"A map service on the www depicting Western Bark Beetle Strategy (WBBS) activities reported through the U.S. Forest Service FACTS database.
